# Python-ML

This project aims to try different Supersioned learning tecniques using Scikit-learn.
In particular I modeled different types of learning models using SVM (Support vector machines), Logistic regression and Decision Tree classifier.

In addiction, I used many preprocessing functions to spare my dataset and also mixed models to compare results.

In conclusion, I tried Ensemble model tecnique chosing different policies.
